## Case-Study-Cyclistic-Bike-Share-




## Introduction
The Cyclistic Bike Share case study revolves around an imaginary company named Cyclistic, located in Chicago.  As a junior data analyst, my responsibility is to examine Cyclistic’s data from the first three months of 2019 and 2020.  The data was collected from a real company as Divvy. 

## About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. 
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Scenario
As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a bike- share company in Chicago, I work on the marketing analyst team. Our director of marketing believes that the success of the company depends on maximizing the number of annal memberships. To achieve this, my team is researching how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. We plan to use this information to develop a new marketing strategy that will convert casual riders into annual members.  However, before we can proceed, Cyclistics executives need to approve our recommendations. As a result, we need to provide compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to support our proposals. 

## Key Stakeholders 
Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels. 
Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals—as well as how I, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them. 
Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

## Business Task
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? 
Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Data Source
The data used for this case study cover rider information from the first three months of 2019 and 2020. This data has been provided by Motivate International Inc. under license and is originally stored in separate CVS files. 

## Objective:
The primary objective is to analyze Cyclisitc bike-sharing data to understand user patterns, ride characteristics, and overall system performance. This information can assist Cyclistic in optimizing its services, improving user experience, and making informed business decisions.

## Analysis Steps

# Step 1: Data Wrangling
The data from 2019 and 2020 was combined by aligning column names, removing unnecessary variables, and adjusting data types for consistency.
# Step 2: Data Cleanup
The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and negative ride lengths. Entries associated with quality checks were also removed to ensure data integrity. 
# Step 3: Descriptive Analysis
Summary statistics were calculated, ride length distribution explored, and user types compared.  Additional columns were added for data, month, day, year, and day of week. 
# Step 4: Insights and Comparisons
The analysis revealed user behavior insights such as average ride lengths, differences between subscriber and customer users, and variations in ride times across different days of the week. 

## Key Findings:

# 1.	User Type Comparison:
•	On average, customers ride for a longer duration compared to subscribers. 
•	On average, subscribers tend to take a shorter and more consistent rides. 
# 2.	Day-of-Week Analysis:
•	On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, customers tend to take a longer rides on average. 
•	In general, subscribers tend to take shorter and more consistent rides throughout the week. 
# 3.	Ride Lengths:
•	The length of the rides taken by customers varies greatly, with some being exceptionally long. 
•	The distribution of ride lengths among subscribers is more concentrated than among non-subscribers. 

## Recommendations

# 1. Customer Engagement Strategies
After analyzing the data, it was found that customers tend to use Cyclistic bikes for longer rides compared to subscribers. To increase customer engagement and loyalty, Cyclistic should consider implementing targeted marketing strategies like promotional offers or rewards programs. These strategies can encourage more frequent usage and longer rides.  
# 2. Operational Optimization on High Traffic Days
The analysis has shown that ride lengths differ on different days of the week. Cyclistic could enhance its operational processes, such as bike distribution and station maintenance, on days when there is more user activity. This could help to enhance to overall efficiency of the service and improve customer satisfaction. 
# 3. Technology Enhancements for Subscriber Experience
A considerable number of users are subscribers, and they usually undertake shorter rides. To improve the overall experience of subscribers and encourage more frequent usage, Cyclistic could prioritize technologies upgrades such as a more advanced mobile app or additional features. 

## Conclusion

After analyzing the data of Cyclistic Bike Share, we have gained important insights into the behavior of users and their ride patterns. I recommended implementing the above-mentioned suggestions to enhance customer engagement, operational efficiency, and the overall user experience. These recommendations can  significantly contribute to the growth and success of Cyclistic Bike Share.
